Movie recommender System using cosine Similarity.


<br>
Cosine similarity is a technique used in Machine Learning to find the similarities between the two documents.
Cosine similarity can be computed amongst arbitrary vectors.
It is a similarity measure (which can be converted to a distance measure, and then be used in any distance based classifier, such as nearest neighbor classification.)

cosφ=a⋅b∥a∥∥b∥
Where 'a' and 'b' are the vectors you want to compare.

If you want to do NN classification, you would use 'a' as your new document, and 'b' as your known sample documents, then classify the new document based on the most similar sample(s).
